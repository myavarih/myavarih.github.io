a sample c code to play a boring game!

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    int secretNumber, userGuess;
    int attempts = 0;

    // Seed for random number generation
    srand(time(NULL));

    // Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    secretNumber = rand() % 100 + 1;

    printf("Welcome to the Guessing Game!\n");
    printf("Try to guess the secret number between 1 and 100.\n\n");

    do {
        printf("Enter your guess: ");
        scanf("%d", &userGuess);

        attempts++;

        if (userGuess == secretNumber) {
            printf("\nCongratulations! You've guessed the correct number in %d attempts.\n", attempts);
        } else if (userGuess < secretNumber) {
            printf("Too low! Try again.\n");
        } else {
            printf("Too high! Try again.\n");
        }

    } while (userGuess != secretNumber);

    return 0;
}
```
